<h2>MAPS Züri Agenda for information and integration</h2>

<h3>Event tips in many languages</h3>

<p>The MAPS Züri Agenda is a monthly event calendar that informs about various low-
budget cultural and recreational activities in the city of Zurich. The event descriptions 
are available in the following languages: Albanian, Arabic, Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian, 
English, French, Italian, Persian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Tamil, and Turkish. 
As of 2015 the calendar will also appear in Mandarin, Somali and Tigrinya.</p>

<h3>Information facilitates integration</h3>

<p>The publication is mainly aimed at foreign-language immigrants, especially those with 
limited financial means. Access to information in their own language helps give them 
largely equal opportunities to take part in an area of public life where individual 
integration is relatively easy to achieve.</p>

<h3>MAPS for everyone!</h3>

<p>Subscribers are private individuals as well as institutions that are in contact with 
foreign-language residents: language schools, residents’ offices, welfare centres,
community centres, immigrant societies, doctor’s offices, etc.</p>
<p>The monthly calendar appears online, as a newsletter and as a printed booklet. It is 
available for free or for a voluntary subscription fee. Subscriptions can be ordered or 
cancelled at 044 415 65 89 or by email at maps@aoz.ch.</p>

<h3>The MAPS makers</h3>

<p>The MAPS project team consists of a project manager, a project assistant and many 
volunteers: 15-20 translators and 6-8 distribution helpers and couriers who bring the 
MAPS Züri Agenda to the subscribers’ letter boxes. </p>

<h3>Promoting integration with support from the public sector</h3>

<p>The first issue of the MAPS Züri Agenda appeared in summer 2001. Since 2006, the 
AOZ has published the event calendar on behalf of the City of Zurich. The project 
team greatly appreciates contributions from individuals and companies who want to 
support this integration project. Please feel free to contact us!</p>
